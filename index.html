                                With help of this software you will be able to send money to other users and receive payments from them.
                                Palladium algorithms make it impossible for other users to know your wallet balance, to whom you send money or where you receive your funds from.

                                Through the usage of some of the available computing power of your computer, you can take part in the operation of the network. Due to this mechanism,
                                transaction processing is decentralized, which allows a person to be not only a user, but also a participant.
                                There are two ways to obtain PC. You can take part in network maintenance and gain a reward for it,
                                or trade for it as with any other currency.

                <p>
                    Money transactions between people are carried out through an intermediary (usually a bank or financial institution)
                    Transaction reliability is guaranteed by an agent who conducts the transaction. Transactions between PalladiumCoin users are
                    carried out through the Internet. Transaction privacy is protected by secure cryptographic algorithms whereby no one
                    can identify who sent the money, who the receiver was, and what amount of money was transferred. PalladiumCoin
                    transaction processing is peformed by the network of users as a whole. Yet no participant has access to the transaction details. All
                    transfers are fully anonymous. The transactions processing requires a considerable amount of computational resources.
                    Those users who joined the network may allocate time of their computers for transaction processing. As a reward they receive PC.
                    This process is called mining. Just as how gold is extracted out of the ground!

                <p>
                    PalladiumCoins are gradually getting more expensive over time, since the emission is limited to 2 million PC. The number of
                    PalladiumCoins emitted each block (every 120 seconds) is slightly decreasing. As a result PC gains value and exchange rate
                    increase. While currencies with sharp decrease of reward per block are exposed to intense declines in network power,
                    PalladiumCoin emission is decreasing slowly, which protects the currency from economic shocks.

                <p>
                    Ryan wants to order food to his place which costs 5 PC, all fees included.
                    He places an order on the website, and he receives his bill that contains the restaurants
                    wallet address. Ryan broadcasts the following instruction to the PalladiumCoin network: send 5 PC from
                    Ryan_address to restaurant_address. Each computer in the network receives this instruction and checks whether this PC
                    Ryan wants to transfer actually belongs to him. The network collects the transactions that need to be processed and packs
                    them up in a block. Each block should comply with specific rules to protect the network from transaction forgery. At some point,
                    one of computers in the network finds the correct block structure and puts it into its blockchain file, which represents
                    the database for all performed transactions. This computer then broadcasts the
                    new block to all other computers in the network for them to update their blockchain files. The transaction is
                    completed and the owner of the computer that was the first to find the correct block structure gets a reward. After the
                    transaction is done, 5 PC belongs to the restaurant and no longer to Ryan.
                    This whole process takes about 2 minutes, and the restaurant owner will get paid before he even starts to cook Ryan’s pizza.
